# ForgeScripts

These are scripts for Forge Rules Engine that I made to help make the experience a little better for me, and now you.


## forge_deck_dl.py

This script allows you to download the card images for specific decks in directories of your choice.

Change the ```deck_dir``` to your directory path as well as the ```output_path``` where the your card images are located.
